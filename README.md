Welcome to statcat.

This is my first project. I plan on making it continuous. Please do not hesitate to make suggestions to my code.

More detailed descriptions will be found wherever I put the documentation later.

For pull requests:
    Generally follow my pattern/style.
    If i'm not following convention, just tell me in the request.
    Otherwise, if it's valid statistics, you're good.

Honestly, I have no idea what I'm doing so I'm trying to keep stuff familiar as I learn.
